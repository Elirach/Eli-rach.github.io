Hi! My name is Charlie Nevitt and I one day want to develop games, both video and board games.  I also want to get into web development because I believe it is one of the best things in our current days to express something.  Whether that be a product, a person or an idea.  Currently, I am a nerd.  I play Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer 40k, Magic the Gathering and so on.
